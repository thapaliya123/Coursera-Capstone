# Predicting accident severity based on collision data
- Road accidents are extremely common. Often times they lead to a loss of property and even life. Wouldn't it be great to be able to understand what are the most common causes, inorder to prevent them from happening?
- With this analysis, I am attempting to understand these factors  and their correlation.  
- With this project one can able to analyse how severe the accident would be corresponding to the following severity category:
  1. Only property damage collision
  2. Injury
  3. Serious Injury
  4. Fatality

**Datasets**  
- The datasets used in this project is seattle collision datasets.
- Datasets contains road collision data from 2004-present.
- Dataset Link: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/collisions

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
1. **Data Understanding and Preparation**:
  - The step is to understand the data i.e. what is its distribution, missing values and many more.
  - Several steps includes:
    - Get basic insights from data 
    - Identify and handle missing values
    - Data Formatting
    - Data Normalization (Centering/Scaling)  
    - Data Bining
    - Turning Categorical values to numerical values
  -  **_data_understanding_preparation.ipynb_** notebook deals with data understanding and data preparation sections
  
2. **Data visualization**
  - Once data is prepared, the next step is to identify the trends in the data
  - Data visualization helps to communicate findings from the data to the stake holder
  - Boxplot, Scatterplot, Bubble plot, Bar chart etc are the basic chart helps to visualize trend in the data
  - **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb** notebook deals with data visualization, by answering several interesting questions
